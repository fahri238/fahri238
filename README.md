# üí´ About Me:
Hello, my name is Muhammad Fahri Ilmi, an Informatics Engineering student currently focusing on frontend web development. At the moment, I‚Äôm working on a final project‚Äîa web-based notebook application that combines productivity features with simple machine learning functionalities. While the machine learning part is handled by my teammate, I‚Äôm fully responsible for both frontend and backend development. I‚Äôm open to collaborating on React-based projects, especially those involving efficient and responsive user interfaces. Currently, I‚Äôm actively seeking internship opportunities as a Frontend Web Developer to further sharpen my skills and contribute in a real-world work environment. I‚Äôm continuously deepening my knowledge of JavaScript, React, and modern web development practices, with a particular interest in user-friendly UI/UX design. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss frontend development or share productivity management tips for students. Fun fact: I enjoy exploring different design approaches and often challenge myself by recreating popular web pages as personal practice.<br>
